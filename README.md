# Vacation and Weather Py Project using Python-Api

The Vacation and Weather Py Project is a Python project that leverages the citipy library and the OpenWeatherMap API to gather data on random cities. This data is then used to create a comprehensive DataFrame containing information such as Latitude, Longitude, Maximum Temperature, Current Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed, and Date of recording for each city.

By executing the WeatherPy.ipynb notebook located in the Resources folder, the initial step is to run the data retrieval process. The notebook retrieves data from the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API, generating a DataFrame that captures the aforementioned weather metrics for the randomized cities. Additionally, a series of scatter plots are created to compare the latitude of each city against each weather metric. The resulting visualizations, along with the DataFrame used to collect the API data, are stored in the Output folder.

The subsequent step involves running the VacationPy.ipynb notebook, also found in the Resources folder. This notebook aims to identify cities that align with the user's ideal vacation location. The cities.csv file, created in the WeatherPy.ipynb notebook, is utilized to map each location, with the size of each dot on the map representing the humidity level of the corresponding city. The parameters can be adjusted to match specific vacation weather preferences or geographical regions based on latitude and longitude. Consequently, a refined DataFrame is generated. Before mapping this refined dataset, a new column is added to hold information about the nearest hotel within a 10,000-meter radius (modifiable through the "radius" variable). The GeoApify API is employed to search for the closest hotels, and the retrieved data is incorporated into the DataFrame. The refined dataset is then mapped, with the dot size still denoting humidity. When hovering over a dot on the map, users can determine if there is a nearby hotel available for their stay.

This project provides an interactive and visually appealing way to explore weather patterns and plan vacations based on individual preferences.
